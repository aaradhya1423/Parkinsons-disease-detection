#Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project applies machine learning and data analytics to detect Parkinson’s disease using patient voice data. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, feature selection, and classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis, data visualization, and class distribution insights.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Model: Training and testing an SVM classifier for disease prediction.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using accuracy scores and other metrics.


Data Analytics Techniques:
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, and data distribution insights.
Data Visualization: Histograms, correlation heatmaps, and box plots for feature analysis.
Feature Correlation Analysis: Identifying important features for classification.
Predictive Analytics: Using machine learning to predict Parkinson’s disease based on voice measurements.


Technologies Used:
Python 
Scikit-learn (SVM, data preprocessing, model evaluation)
Jupyter Notebook for development and analysis
